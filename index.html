    <h1>Out from Underground</h1>
    <h3>How new bills in the state legislature could transform New York’s psilocybin culture</h3>
    <h4>By Gabrielle Santas</h4>
    </div>

<div class="story">
<p>“The truth is that so many people in New York are already buying and using psilocybin,” said Joe McKay, a retired FDNY firefighter, stating what may be already obvious to a panel of state lawmakers on Sept. 30th. “But they're doing so with no regulations on what they're purchasing and no education on how to safely use the medication.” </p>

<p>McKay, like many New Yorkers, turned to the black market to buy psilocybin—the psychoactive compound in “magic mushrooms”—to relieve his chronic cluster headaches condition, which he described as feeling “as if someone stabbed me in the eye with an icepick.” He spent thousands of dollars to get no answers from doctors, no relief from morphine, and no solutions from the mainstream medical system.</p> 

<p>“It's time that we try something different,” says Avery Stempel, co-president of New Yorkers for Mental Health Alternatives, who has spent the last four years lobbying Albany lawmakers to legalize psilocybin.</p> 

<p>New bills introduced this year in the New York Assembly could make Stempel’s vision a reality. But, as McKay pointed out, psilocybin use is already widespread—just unregulated. Here’s how the proposed legislation would change that landscape.</p>

<p class="heading">New, effective treatments for patients</p>

<p>McKay says that low doses of psilocybin—not “seeing pink elephants” level, just enough that “the colors are a little brighter”—are the only thing that brings him relief. “Psilocybin gave me my life back,” he said.</p>

<p>A growing body of research shows that psilocybin is an effective treatment for myriad conditions, from cluster headaches and migraines to treatment resistant depression, anxiety, and end of life ennui. Still, it remains a Schedule I substance under federal law, defined as having “no currently accepted medical use” (US DEA). One of the proposed bills would create a pilot program for veterans.

<p class="heading">Underground guides to licensed facilitators.</p> 

Today, psilocybin therapy happens in private spaces. Under a new bill, facilitators could be certified through a training program and operate legally in designated centers.

<p class="heading">Hobbyist growers to certified cultivator</p>

<p>The legislation would allow people like Stempel, who grows psilocybin on a farm in upstate New  York, to apply for cultivation and testing licenses. This would create safety standards and local supply chains.</p>

<p>Yet, legislation often comes with a price tag. Cannabis reform offers a cautionary tale: once licensing opens, well-funded companies can edge out small producers.

<p class="heading">Increased access to what is currently an elite-only therapy</p>

<p>Like McKay noted, plenty of New Yorkers have already discovered psilocybin’s benefits. But, those users are overwhelmingly economically privileged, people who can afford expensive alternative therapy and can shoulder the risk of fines if caught. New legislation would decriminalize psilocybin and bring down costs for clinical use.

<p class="heading">Shifting taboos</p>

<p>Magic mushrooms have long been associated with consciousness-raising hippies of the 1960s. Now people like McKay, heroes and people in uniform who suffer from PTSD and could be helped by these drugs, are becoming the new face of the movement.
